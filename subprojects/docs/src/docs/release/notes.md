## Upgrade Instructions

Switch your build to use Gradle @version@ by updating your wrapper:

`./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version=@version@`

See the [Gradle 6.x upgrade guide](userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#changes_@baseVersion@) to learn about deprecations, breaking changes and other considerations when upgrading to Gradle @version@.

For Java, Groovy, Kotlin and Android compatibility, see the [full compatibility notes](userguide/compatibility.html).

## Improved handling of ZIP archives on runtime classpaths
Runtime classpath analysis can now inspect manifest and `META-INF` properties files, ignore changes to comments, and selectively ignore attributes or properties that don't impact the
runtime classpath.

```groovy
normalization {
    runtimeClasspath {
        metaInf {
            ignoreAttribute("Implementation-Version")
            ignoreProperty("timestamp")
        }
    }
}
```

This improves the likelihood of [build cache hits](userguide/build_cache.html) when jar and property files on the classpath are regenerated and only differ by unimportant values or comments.

See the [userguide](userguide/more_about_tasks.html#sec:meta_inf_normalization) for further information.  Note that this API is incubating and will likely change in future releases as support
is expanded for normalizing properties files outside of `META-INF`.

## Gradle module metadata can be made reproducible

The Gradle Module Metadata file contains a build identifier field which defaults to a unique ID generated during build execution.
This results in the generated file being different at each build execution.

This value can now be disabled at the publication level, allowing users to opt-in for a reproducible Gradle Module Metadata file.

```groovy
main(MavenPublication) {
    from components.java
    withoutBuildIdentifier()
}
```

See the documentation for more information on [Gradle Module Metadata generation](userguide/publishing_gradle_module_metadata.html#sub:gmm-reproducible).

## Variant-aware dependency substitution rules

Previously, it wasn't possible for Gradle to substitute a dependency which uses a classifier with a dependency without classifier, nor was it possible to substitute a dependency _without_ classifier with a classified dependency.
Similarly, dependencies with attributes (typically "platform" dependencies) or capabilities (typically "test fixtures" dependencies) could not be substituted.

Gradle now supports substitution of dependencies with classifiers, attributes or capabilities.
Gradle's dependency substitution API has been enriched to cover those cases.

See the documentation on [variant-aware substitution](userguide/file:///home/cchampeau/DEV/PROJECTS/GITHUB/gradle/subprojects/docs/build/working/usermanual/render-multi/resolution_rules.html#sec:variant_aware_substitutions) for details.

## Credentials API

TBD 

## Improvements for plugin authors

### Injectable `ArchiveOperations` service

Previously, it was only possible to create a `FileTree` for a ZIP or TAR archive by using the APIs provided by a `Project`.
However, a `Project` object is not always available.

The new `ArchiveOperations` service has [zipTree()](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ArchiveOperations.html#zipTree-java.lang.Object-) and [tarTree()](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ArchiveOperations.html#tarTree-java.lang.Object-) methods for creating read-only `FileTree` instances respectively for ZIP and TAR archives.

See the [user manual](userguide/custom_gradle_types.html#service_injection) for how to inject services and the [`ArchiveOperations`](javadoc/org/gradle/api/file/ArchiveOperations.html) api documentation for more details and examples.
